1. Install docker for desktop if you have not already installed it https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
Enable kubernetes on it
Takes a while to loadup

==> first time ONLY install the kubernetes dashboard
https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v1.10.1/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml

2. run
kubectl proxy
http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/


To get bearer tokenservice
https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/wiki/Creating-sample-user

You will see a login, choose "Token" and the run this in a powershell window (or git bash prompt)
and copy the whole token string that comes out:
kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $(kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep admin-user | awk '{print $1}')

==>

if "kubectl get nodes" comes up, you're good to go
go to your root directory of your app (the one with "./src" off it)
then go into "kompose"
may want to shutdown IIS since you're running on port 80
3. cd into kompose

4. Run "cleanup.sh" if you have any pods running (ie, "kubectl get pods" returns data)

5. Open up startup.sh and follow the instructions of the comments.

After starting up all of the pods, you should see something like

> kubectl get pods (or you can look at the "Pods" on your dashboard app)
