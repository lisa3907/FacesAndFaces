# K8 Orchestrations for the ASP .NET Core Microservices Course
These are kubernetes orchestration files (in the "kompose" directory) for the awesome course (highly recommended) that I bought here that teaches you how to write production grade microservices.

https://www.udemy.com/course/aspnet-core-20-e-commerce-web-site-based-on-microservices-and-docker/

This course is highly recommended.  Keep an eye out for future releases/upgrades to this course that will 
include new technologies including the possibility of orchestrations.

I can't recommend this course enough.  The application he creates and walks you thru will run on both a Kubernetes Cluster and a Docker compose environment.
